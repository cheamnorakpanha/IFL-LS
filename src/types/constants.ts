    title: "Désirée's Baby",
    author: "Kate Chopin",
    description:
      "“Désirée's Baby” is a captivating short story by Kate Chopin, first published in Vogue magazine in 1893 and later included in her collection Bayou Folk in 1894. Set in antebellum Louisiana, the story delves into themes of slavery, the Southern social system, Creole culture, and the ambiguity of racial identity. It centers on Désirée, a young woman who marries a prominent Louisiana family, but a secret concerning race and identity disrupts their seemingly idyllic life.",
    content: `The story opens with Madame Valmonde visiting Desiree and her baby. On her way to L'Abri, she reminisces about Desiree's childhood. Desiree was a foundling discovered by Monsieur Valmonde. He found her "lying in the shadow of the big stone pillar" as he was galloping through the gateway to Valmonde. The general opinion was that she was left behind by a "party of Texans," but Madame Valmonde believed Desiree was sent to her by God as she was not able to have her children.

Eighteen years later, Armand Aubigny suddenly falls in love with Desiree when he sees her standing against the stone pillar, even though they have known each other since they were small children, ever since Armand and his father came from Paris after his mother died. Monsieur Valmonde proposes that before their relationship becomes more serious, Desiree's origins should be examined. However, Armand is so in love that he does not care about Desiree's ancestors and decides it does not matter that she does not have a family name of her own if he can give her a perfectly good one, and so they get married.

Madame Valmonde has a surprise awaiting her. She has not seen the baby for a month, and when she arrives in L'Abri, she is shocked to see the baby's appearance. Desiree remarks about how much he has grown. However, she does not see anything wrong with her son. She is very happy. Ever since the baby was born, her husband, Armand, who was very strict and harsh, has softened a great deal.

When the baby is three months old, the situation in the house changes. Desiree senses there is something wrong. On top of that, Armand becomes cold and avoids both Desiree and the baby. One afternoon, Desiree is sitting in her room and starts observing her child and a little quadroon boy who is fanning it. The similarity between them frightens her, and she sends the boy away.

When Armand arrives back home, Desiree asks him about the baby. He responds that indeed the baby is not white, which means that she is not white either. Desiree points out all her physical features that strongly suggest that she is white, but her angry husband tells her she is as white as their mixed-race slaves.

Desperate, Desiree writes to her mother, Madame Valmonde, asking for help. Madame Valmonde tells her to come back home because she still loves her. Afterward, Desiree asks her husband about his opinion, and he sends her away. As a result of that, Desiree takes her baby and leaves the house. However, she does not take the road leading to the Valmonde; instead, she disappears into the bayou.

Several weeks later, Armand sets up a bonfire to get rid of Desiree's belongings. Among the stuff he decides to throw away, Armand finds several letters. Most of them are "little scribblings" Desiree sent him in the days of their engagement, but he also finds one that is addressed from his mother to his father. In the letter, his mother thanks God for her husband's love, but she also reveals that she is grateful that her son will never know that his mother "belongs to the race that is cursed by slavery."`,

    title: "Not Poor, Just Broke",
    author: "Dick Gregory",
    description:
      "“In the short story “Not Poor, Just Broke” by Dick Gregory, the author shares a powerful and poignant true account of his family's struggle with poverty during the 1930s. The narrative revolves around young Richard, who demonstrates resourcefulness and intelligence despite their financial constraints.",
    content: `The author recounts their childhood experiences with Helene Tucker, a light-complexioned and smart girl. He was in love with her and would often go to school to look at her. Despite the harsh winter conditions, he would wash their clothes every night and buy ice from Mister Ben's grocery store to make them dry. Helene was a symbol of everything he wanted. Richard would sometimes run out on the street to meet Helene, shovel snow off her walk, and try to make friends with her family. He would also drop money on her stoop late at night while shining shoes in taverns. Helene had a good-looking daddy who was a paper hanger.

Richard may have gotten over Helene by summertime, but something happened in that classroom that made her face hang in front of them for the next twenty-two years. When he played the drums in high school, it was for Helene, and when he broke track records in college, it was for Helene. It wasn't until they were 29 years old, married, and making money that Richard finally got her out of their system. Helene was sitting in the classroom when Richard learned to be ashamed of himself. On Thursday, the teacher thought Richard was stupid, as they couldn't spell, read, or do arithmetic. They were never interested in finding out about his struggles. He was so hungry because he hadn't had any breakfast., as he only thought about noontime and how they could steal lunch from the cloakroom.

Richard's experiences as a pregnant child include poverty, dirt, smells, colds, shoes, and hunger. The teacher thought Richard was a troublemaker, but she couldn't see a black boy who made noises to let others know he was there. On Thursday, the day before the Negro payday, the teacher asked each student how much their father would give to the Community Chest. Richard decided to buy him a Daddy immediately, using money from his pocket and Helene Tucker's pledge for her Daddy.

The teacher called out names alphabetically, and Richard felt good about his Daddy. He had almost three dollars in dimes and quarters in his pocket, waiting for the teacher to call his name. However, the teacher closed her book after calling everyone else in the class. Richard raises his hand, and the teacher tells him that Richard Gregory forgot him. She turns towards the blackboard, saying she doesn't have time to play with him. Richard's father promised to give him fifteen dollars, but the teacher looks mad and says they are collecting this money for him and his kind. If Richard's father can give him fifteen dollars, he has no business being on relief.

Helene Tucker is shocked and feels sorry for him. She reveals that the world knows he doesn't have a father, and Richard is left feeling ashamed. He always thought the teacher liked him, as he was chosen to wash the blackboard on Fridays after school. Richard walks out of school that day, feeling ashamed. Everyone inside the classroom hears the teacher's words and feels sorry for him. He feels ashamed for attending the Worthy Boys Annual Christmas Dinner, wearing the uniform provided by the welfare department, and walking down the street in a warm mackinaw. His mother beats him and calls him a little rat when she finds out he stuffed it in a garbage pail.

Richard also feels shame for running to Mister Ben's for rotten peaches, asking Mrs. Simmoms for sugar, and meeting the relief truck. He hates the truck and hides when it arrives. He sneaks through alleys to avoid being seen by people going into White's Eat Shop. The whole world hears the teacher's words, and Richard realizes that he doesn't have a father.`,

    title: "Oliver Twist",
    author: "Charles Dickens",
    description:
      "“Oliver Twist, a novel by Charles Dickens, was published serially from 1837 to 1839. The story follows the titular orphan named Oliver, who, after being raised in a workhouse, escapes to London, where he meets a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin, discovers the secrets of his parentage, and reconnects with his remaining family.",
    content: `Oliver Twist begins in a workhouse in 1830s England, in an unnamed village, where a young woman, revealed to be Oliver's mother, gives birth to her son and promptly dies. The boy, lucky to survive, is raised until the age of nine on a "farm" for young orphaned children and then is sent to the local workhouse again, where he labors for a time until his innocent request for more food so angers the house's board and beadle, Mr. Bumble, that the workhouse attempts to foist Oliver off as an apprentice to some worker in the villager. Oliver is eventually given over to a coffin maker named Sowerberry. Oliver works as a "mute" mourner for Sowerberry and must sleep at night among the coffins. After a fight with Noah, another of Sowerberry's apprentices, over Oliver's unwed mother (whom Noah insults), Oliver runs away to London to make his fortune.

Near London, Oliver meets a well-dressed young boy who introduces himself as the Artful Dodger, a thief under the employ of a local crime boss named Fagin. The Dodger takes Oliver to Fagin, who promises to help Oliver but holds him hostage and forces him to go on a thieving mission with the Dodger and Bates, another young criminal. Bates and Dodger try to steal the handkerchief of an old man, who notices Oliver (an innocent onlooker) and believes him to be the thief. Oliver is caught and hauled to jail, only to be released into the old man Brownlow's company after Brownlow sees that Oliver had nothing to do with the crime. Brownlow nurses Oliver for a time and vows to educate him properly. But after sending Oliver out to return some books and money to a bookseller, Brownlow is shocked to find that Oliver does not return—Oliver has been picked up by Nancy, an associate of Fagin's, and taken back to the criminal gang.

The remainder of the novel comprises Brownlow's attempts to find Oliver and Oliver's attempts to escape Fagin, his criminal associate Sikes, and the other boys. Fagin orders Oliver to accompany Sikes and another thief named Toby Crackit on a house-breaking in a country village that goes awry; Oliver is shot in the arm in the attempt by a servant named Giles of the Maylie house (the house being broken into); Oliver nearly dies, but walks back to the house the next morning and is nursed back to health by Rose, Mrs. Maylie, and a local doctor named Lorsborne. Lorsborne later takes Oliver into London to find Brownlow, but they discover Brownlow has gone to visit the West Indies. Oliver is crestfallen but is happy nonetheless with the Maylies, and he is educated by an old man in the Maylies' village. Later, on a trip to London, Rose is visited by Nancy, who wishes to come clean about her involvement in Oliver's oppression, and Oliver finds that Brownlow is back in the city, having returned from the West Indies.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Corney, mistress of the workhouse, receives a package from a dying woman named Old Sally, which Sally in turn receives from Oliver's mother upon her death. The package contains material indicating Oliver's family history, which is of interest to a friend and shadowy associate of Fagin's named Monks. Nancy meets with Rose and Brownlow in secret in London to discuss what she has overheard from Fagin and Monks regarding Oliver's parentage. Noah, sent to spy on Nancy, overhears this conversation and reports it to Fagin. Fagin tells Sikes, misleadingly, that Nancy has "peached" on the whole gang (even though Nancy refused to incriminate Fagin or Sikes to Brownlow), and Sikes, in a fit of rage, kills Nancy, then goes on the lam with his dog.

Brownlow realizes that he recognized Oliver as resembling the picture of a woman in his parlor and also recognized a man he came to realize was Monks. Brownlow pieces together the mystery of Oliver's parentage: Oliver's father is also Monk's father, and Monk's mother defrauded Oliver's mother, an unwed woman named Agnes, of the inheritance Oliver's father, Edwin, intended to leave to Oliver and Agnes. Monks wish to destroy these facts about Oliver's parentage to keep all the inheritance for himself. But Brownlow confronts Monks with these facts, and Monks agrees, finally, to sign an affidavit admitting his part in the conspiracy to defraud Oliver.

Meanwhile, the members of Fagin's gang are all caught: Noah; Charlotte, his partner; the Dodger; and Fagin himself. Sikes dies by accident, attempting to escape a mob that has come to kill him following Nancy's death. Brownlow manages to secure half of Oliver's inheritance for Oliver and gives the other half to Monks, who spend it in the New World on criminal activity. Rose Maylie, long in love with her cousin Harry, eventually marries him after Harry purposefully lowers his social station to correspond with Rose's. Rose was said to be of a blighted family, and in the novel's final surprise, this "blight" is revealed: Rose's sister was Agnes, meaning that Rose is Oliver's aunt.

At the novel's end, Oliver is restored to his rightful lineage and is adopted by Brownlow. The pair live in the country with Harry, who has become a parson, and Rose, along with Losborne and Mrs. Maylie. Oliver can, at last, be educated in the tranquility and manner he deserves as the son of a gentleman.`,

    author: "Roald Dahl",
    description:
      "“Poison is a short story by Roald Dahl that was originally published in June 1950",
    content: `Timber Woods, the narrator, arrives home at his bungalow to discover his partner, Harry Pope, lying in bed and acting strangely. Harry is whispering and sweating all over. He tells Timber that a krait—an extremely poisonous little snake—crawled onto the bed and is now sleeping under the sheet on Harry's stomach.

Timber gets a knife from the kitchen in case Harry gets bitten, which he'll use to cut the skin and suck out the poison. Harry tells him to call the doctor. Doctor Ganderbai agrees to come at once. Once he arrives, he quickly decides that the first thing to do is inject Harry with some snakebite serum. Carefully, Ganderbai rolls up Harry's pajama sleeve and ties on a rubber tourniquet. Harry is struggling not to move or cough. Ganderbai smoothly inserts the needles and administers the serum.

Outside, the doctor tells Timber that the serum is by no means a guarantee of safety. They decide to try to anesthetize the snake. They use chloroform to soak the mattress beneath Harry. The process is agonizing and takes a long time. Eventually, they begin to slowly lift the sheet off Harry. They see no sign of the snake.

“It could be up the leg of his pajamas,” says Ganderbai. At that, Harry goes berserk and leaps to his feet, shaking his legs violently. When he stops, they realize that he hasn't been bitten and that the snake is nowhere to be seen.

paragraph 5
“Mr. Pope, you are of course quite sure you saw it in the first place?” asks Ganderbai. Harry turns red and asks if Ganderbai is accusing him of being a liar. When the doctor doesn't reply, Harry begins screaming horrible racist insults at him. The doctor quickly leaves.

Timber stops the doctor outside and apologizes to Harry. He thanks the doctor for his help. “All he needs is a good holiday,” Ganderbai says quietly before driving off.`,

    title: "The Drover's Wife",
    author: "Henry Lawson",
    description:
      "“The Drover's Wife” is a short story written by Australian author Henry Lawson. Originally published in the July 1892 edition of Bulletin Magazine, the story is set in the Australian outback and revolves around an unnamed woman who lives in an isolated hut with her four children.",
    content: `The bush woman is alerted to the fact that a snake has just entered her small, ramshackle house deep in the Australian outback by her eldest son, Tommy. Tommy goes after the snake with a stick, and the family dog, Alligator, follows suit. Both are unable to catch the snake, however, which slips under the floorboards of the house. Aware that a snake bite so far from help would be deadly, the bush woman unsuccessfully attempts to lure the snake out. With the sun setting and a thunderstorm on the horizon, she sets up a bed on the kitchen table for her children, where they will be out of the snake's reach.

The bush woman once dreamt of a more comfortable life and enjoyed being pampered by her husband, a drover. Ever since he lost everything in a drought, however, she has grown used to being alone and working tirelessly to ensure her family's survival. Although she does not see her husband very often, he treats her well. However, because he is gone for long periods, she is left to take care of the family on her own and protect them from the various threats they face in the bush. She once nearly died in childbirth and only survived with the help of a local Aboriginal couple. When one of her children died, she rode nearly 20 miles with the child's body in search of help. She also once fought a bushfire that nearly consumed the house, managing to put it out with the help of four bushmen who arrived at the last minute.

She has not always won against the assaults of nature; she cried after a flood broke through the dam her husband had built, and she lost two of her two best cows to illness. But she has successfully fought off many wild animals and also held her own against men who have come to the door while her husband is away. She has few pleasures in the outback, though she makes time to read the Young Ladies' Journal and is sure to dress herself and her children up every Sunday and go for long walks through the bush with her baby carriage.

The bush woman realizes that her candle is about to go out, so she goes to get some wood from the woodpile. When she does so, the woodpile collapses, causing her to realize that the Aboriginal man who constructed it must have deceived her by building it hollow. She begins to cry, but soon calms down. Alligator suddenly approaches the partition between the kitchen and the rest of the house, and the bush woman realizes that the snake must be emerging. She grabs her stick, but Alligator gets there first. The dog grabs the snake with his mouth and shakes it until it dies. The woman then throws the snake's remains into the fire. Tommy embraces his mother and promises that he will never be a drover like his father.`,

    title: "The Happy Prince",
    author: "Oscar Wilde",
    description:
      "“The Happy Prince” is a short story by Oscar Wilde. It revolves around an unusual bond between the status of a prince and a compassionate swallow.",
    content: `The Happy Prince of the story's title refers to a statue made of lead but painted all over with gold. The statue's eyes are sapphires, and in the hilt of the sword he holds is a bright red ruby. The statue stands high above a city and is admired by those who live there because he looks happy and 'like an angel'.

One night, a swallow flies over the city, having stayed behind in northern Europe when his friends flew south to Egypt for the winter. The Swallow had stayed behind for love; he is in love with a Reed he met in the spring. However, he begins to tire of Reed because she flirts with the wind every time it blows, and when he asks her if she will come away with him, she appears to shake her head.

The swallow flies south, stopping the following night to rest. It just so happens that he arrives in the city where the statue of the Happy Prince is located. He decides to sleep underneath the statue of the Happy Prince that night, but when the statue starts to cry on him, he strikes up a conversation with it. It turns out the Happy Prince isn't so happy. In life, he had been a wealthy and privileged man who had been sheltered from the misery and hardship of ordinary people in the city. Only in death, when he became this statue looking down on the city and its inhabitants, has he come to realize how many people suffer and struggle.

He tells the Swallow to take the ruby from his sword hilt and deliver it to a poor seamstress whose son is ill. The swallow reluctantly agrees. When he returns, he tells the Happy Prince what he has done and that he feels warm, even though the air is cold. The Happy Prince tells him that he has been warmed inside because he has done a good deed.

The next day, the Swallow prepares to bid the Happy Prince farewell as he must fly to Egypt to join his friends. But the Happy Prince persuades him to take the sapphire out of one of his eye sockets and take it to the poor young man, who is so poor he is freezing in his garret and cannot finish the play he is writing. Once again, the Swallow does as the statue requests—though again, he does so reluctantly, this time because he doesn't want to rob the Happy Prince of one of his eyes.

The next day, the Swallow once again says he must leave the Happy Prince and fly to Egypt, but the Happy Prince persuades the Swallow to remove the other sapphire from his eye socket and take it to the little match girl, who has dropped her matches in the gutter and will be beaten if she returns home empty-handed. The Swallow doesn't want to remove the statue's second sapphire because it will leave the Happy Prince blind, but the Prince insists.

Finally, the Happy Prince, having heard from the Swallow that children are starving in the city streets, insists that the Swallow remove the gold leaf that covers him and take it to the children so they can buy food with it. When the Swallow returns, having done this deed, he grows colder and colder, and, after kissing the Happy Prince on the lips, he drops down dead at his feet. The prince dies from a broken heart. The next day, the mayor and his town councilors notice the lead statue without its gold coating and its jewels and remark how ugly it looks. They also notice the dead swallow at the foot of the statue but express nothing but contempt for the dead bird. They have the statue of the Happy Prince torn down and decide that the lead will be melted down to make a new statue (of one of the Councilors, naturally).

But God, watching from heaven, tells one of his angels to bring him the two most precious things in the city. The Angel brings him the lead heart from the Happy Prince (which wouldn't melt when the rest of the statue was melted down) and the body of the dead Swallow who loved the Happy Prince. God announces that the bird will sing in heaven forevermore, and the Happy Prince will praise God in his 'city of gold'.`,

It was originally published in the July 1977 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, and later included in Dahl's short story collection The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More. The story is about a man who picks up a hitch-hiker while driving to London.",
    content: `The narrator is driving to London in his new BMW 1975 car when he picks up a hitchhiker. The narrator always picks up hitchhikers since, in early times, he also used to hitchhike and he knew how difficult it can be. The author describes the hitchhiker as a small, ratty-faced man with gray teeth. The man mentions he's going to the horse races, but not to bet or work the ticket machines. The narrator is intrigued and says he's a writer, while the hitchhiker claims to be in a highly skilled trade.

They get to talking about the car, and the narrator proudly states it can hit 129 miles per hour. The hitchhiker doubts that, so once they hit a straight patch of road, the narrator accelerates. They are stopped by a policeman on a motorcycle, who is a bit of a bully and threatens to have the narrator thrown in prison. He takes down his address and also that of the hitchhiker, who claims to be a hod-carrier. Then he gives them a ticket and leaves, and they continue on their way.

The narrator is worried about the ticket, but the hitchhiker says it will be fine. The narrator then asks why the hitchhiker lied to the policeman about his job and wonders if he is ashamed of it. The hitchhiker takes offense at the implication that he would be ashamed of his work, and the narrator tries to guess what his true occupation is. After several failed guesses, the hitchhiker reveals that he has taken several of the narrator's belongings without the narrator noticing, then explains that he is an extremely skilled pickpocket, although he refers to himself as a "finger smith." He makes a living by attending races and stealing money from the winners and the rich, and he proudly announces that he has never been caught.

The narrator is concerned that the policeman will be checking up on the hitchhiker, but the hitchhiker is confident that no one will be checking up on him, as policemen have notoriously bad memories. The narrator points out that the policeman has the details written down in his book, only for the hitchhiker to reveal that he's stolen both books from the policeman. They pull off the road to burn the books, and the narrator admires the hitchhiker's skills.`,

    description:
      "“The Necklace” is a short story by French writer Guy de Maupassant, first published in 1884. It tells the story of Mathilde Loisel, a young woman who borrows a necklace from a wealthy friend to wear to a high-society event, only to lose it and spend the next ten years of her life in poverty trying to replace it.",
    content: `Mathilde Loisel is “pretty and charming” but feels she has been born into a family of unfavorable economic status. She was married off to a lowly clerk in the Ministry of Education, who could afford to provide her with a modest, though not uncomfortable, lifestyle. Mathilde feels the burden of her poverty intensely. She regrets her lot in life and spends endless hours imagining a more extravagant existence. While her husband expresses his pleasure at the small, modest supper she has prepared for him, she dreams of an elaborate feast served in fancy China and eaten in the company of wealthy friends. She possesses no fancy jewels or clothing, yet these are the only things she lives for. Without them, she feels she is not desirable. She has one wealthy friend, Madame Forestier, but refuses to visit her because of the heartbreak it brings her.

One night, her husband returns home proudly bearing an invitation to a formal party hosted by the Ministry of Education. He hopes that Mathilde will be thrilled with the chance to attend an event of this sort, but she is instantly angry and begins to cry. Through her tears, she tells him that she has nothing to wear and he ought to give the invitation to one of his friends whose wife can afford better clothing. Her husband is upset by her reaction and asks how much a suitable dress would cost. She thinks about it carefully and tells him that 400 francs would be enough. Her husband quietly balks at the sum but agrees that she may have the money.

As the day of the party approaches, Mathilde starts to behave oddly. She confesses that the reason for her behavior is her lack of jewels. Monsieur Loisel suggests that she wear flowers, but she refuses. He implores her to visit Madame Forestier and borrow something from her. Madame Forestier agrees to lend Mathilde her jewels, and Mathilde selects a diamond necklace. She is overcome with gratitude at Madame Forestier's generosity.

At the party, Mathilde is the most beautiful woman in attendance, and everyone notices her. She is intoxicated by the attention and has an overwhelming sense of self-satisfaction. At 4 a.m., she finally looks for Monsieur Loisel, who has been dozing for hours in a deserted room. He cloaks her bare shoulders in a wrap and cautions her to wait inside, away from the cold night air, while he fetches a cab. But she is ashamed of the shabbiness of her wrap and follows Monsieur Loisel outside. They walk for a while before hailing a cab.

When they finally return home, Mathilde is saddened that the night has ended. As she removes her wrap, she discovers that her necklace is no longer around her neck. In a panic, Monsieur Loisel goes outside and retraces their steps. Terrified, she sits and waits for him. He returns home much later, in an even greater panic—he has not found the necklace. He instructs her to write to Madame Forestier and say that she has broken the clasp of the necklace and is getting it mended.

They continue to look for the necklace. After a week, Monsieur Loisel says they have to see about replacing it. They visit many jewelers, searching for a similar necklace, and finally find one. It costs 40,000 francs, although the jeweler says he will give it to them for 36,000. The Loisels spend a week scraping up money from all kinds of sources, mortgaging the rest of their existence. After three days, Monsieur Loisel purchases the necklace. When Mathilde returns the necklace, in its case, to Madame Forestier, Madame Forestier is annoyed at how long it has taken to get it back but does not open the case to inspect it. Mathilde is relieved.

The Loisels began to live a life of crippling poverty. They dismiss their servant and move into an even smaller apartment. Monsieur Loisel works three jobs, and Mathilde spends all her time doing the heavy housework. This misery lasts ten years, but in the end, they have repaid their financial debts. Mathilde's extraordinary beauty is now gone; she looks just like the other women in poor households. They are both tired and irrevocably damaged from these years of hardship.

One Sunday, while she is out for a walk, Mathilde spots Madame Forestier. Feeling emotional, she approaches her and offers greetings. Madame Forestier does not recognize her, and when Mathilde identifies herself, Madame Forestier cannot help but exclaim that she looks different. Mathilde says that the change was on her account and explains to her the long saga of losing the necklace, replacing it, and working for ten years to repay the debts. At the end of her story, Madame Forestier clasps her hands and tells Mathilde that the original necklace was just costume jewelry and not worth anything.`,

It tells the thoughts of a woman, Louise Mallard, who has heart trouble after she hears that her husband has died in an accident. She feels a sense of freedom from her unhappy marriage, but her joy is short-lived.",
    content: `Louise Mallard has heart trouble, so she must be informed carefully about her husband's death. Her sister, Josephine, tells her the news. Louise's husband's friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he was in the newspaper office and saw Louise's husband, Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her of Brently's death and goes upstairs to be alone in her room.

Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he's selling. She hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She is young, with lines around her eyes. Still crying, she gazes into the distance. She feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her, but she can't. She begins repeating the word free! to herself over and over again. Her heart beats quickly, and she feels very warm.

Louise knows she'll cry again when she sees Brently's corpse. His hands were tender, and he always looked at her lovingly. But then she imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her now, and spreads her arms out joyfully with anticipation. She will be free on her own, without anyone to oppress her. She thinks that all women and men oppress one another, even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she often feels love for Brently, but she tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She feels ecstatic with her newfound sense of independence.

Josephine comes to her door, begging Louise to come out, warning her that she'll get sick if she doesn't. Louise tells her to go away. She fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she lives a long life. Then she opens the door, and she and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richards is waiting.

The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He hadn't been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him. Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of a heart attack brought on by happiness.`,

The man ran away with the money, and the father stopped working and started drinking excessively, which put a strain on the family.

Hari begins to think about better ways in which he could help his family and believes their prospects might get better when he hears that a factory will be built in their village. All of Hari's friends are excited, but Hari tries to have a more realistic view of whether he will find work in the factory.

Their situation changes a bit when the de Silva family comes into the village. They are a rich family who vacations at their seaside home several times a year, and they always employ the children. Lila and Hari start helping them and become their servants. After finding out about their situation, Mr. de Silva offers Hari a job in Bombay as a car washer. At first, Hari is suspicious of his offer but then analyzes his situation and reaches the conclusion that Lila will never be able to find a good husband without money and that it is now his responsibility to provide for his family.

The factory man begins to cause a stir when he tells Hari and other villagers about the major changes the fertilizer factory will bring: jobs for skilled people, land set aside for houses for the thousands who will flood in, the removal of rice and other crops, etc. This causes consternation among the villagers, and soon a protest begins to form. A group of men led by the charismatic Adarkar decide to go to Bombay to speak with the government.

Hari is roused by the words of Adarkar and decides to go to Bombay to stand up for his people. He does not tell his sisters. When he arrives in Bombay, he is stunned by the city—its buildings, its crowds, the smells and noises, the cars. He listens to Adarkar and other speakers, but quickly realizes he has no role to play. All of a sudden, he is aware of his impetuosity for coming here, and he feels very alone. He remembers Mr. de Silva's offer and manages to find the residence, but the rude servant tells him that de Silvas is not in town. A kindly watchman tells him he will take him to his friend Jagu.

Jagu agrees to let Hari work in his restaurant, so Hari sends home a postcard letting his sisters know where he is and that he is going to bring his earnings to them. Life is hard for Hari in Bombay, but he works hard. While working for Jagu, Hari meets Mr. Panwallah, who takes Hari under his wing and starts to teach him how to make watches and how to repair them.

During the time Hari is in Bombay, Lila finds succor from the de Silva family. When they come for their vacation, Lila works for them. She asks Mr. de Silva to take her mother to the hospital when she hears he is driving that way, and he immediately agrees and says he will take care of everything. When Lila's father hears of this, he yells at her in a drunken rage, but he goes to the hospital and remains by his wife's side. He also gives up drinking and is much more subdued. Lila visits every week, and her mother improves more and more. The de Silvas depart, but another guest stays in the home—a venerable political leader studying birds that, coincidentally, Hari heard speak in Bombay. He is quiet and kind and pays the girls well.

Monsoon season is hard for both Hari in Bombay and the villagers by the sea. When Hari hears on the radio that fishing boats out of Alibagh were lost in a storm, he decides he must return home. He knows he belongs with his family by the sea. He decides to go to Diwali and continues to learn the watchmaking trade from Mr. Panwallah in the interim.

Hari returns and has an emotional reunion with his sisters. He is stunned to hear of his mother's improvement and his father's sobriety. He tells Lila that he has decided to start a small business raising animals while thinking that he will open his watch shop in the future; both business options are good for when the factory crowds come. Hari visits his mother in the hospital and is thrilled to see that the years of illness have passed. His father also seems pleased to see him in his gruff way. Hari and his father can take Mother home for Diwali.

The celebrations are delightful and heartwarming for the family. Hari slips away for a moment during the preparations to see the man at the Mon Repos. He talks with him briefly about bird watching and suddenly realizes that he is Sayyid Ali, the impassioned speaker from Bombay. Ali is like Mr. Panwallah but expresses sadness about the changes coming to Alibagh. Hari tells him what he is doing, and Ali perks up, admiring Hari's will to adapt.

The story ends with the family contentedly celebrating, grateful for the positive changes in their lives.`,

    author: "William Shakespeare",
    description:
      "“Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about the romance of two Italian adolescents from rival households. It was one of Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime, and it is still produced often now, alongside Hamlet.Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.",
    content: `In the streets of Verona, another brawl breaks out between the servants of the feuding noble families of Capulet and Montague. Benvolio, a Montague, tries to stop the fighting, but he is himself embroiled when Tybalt, a rash Capulet, arrives on the scene. After citizens outraged by the constant violence beat back the warring factions, Prince Escalus, the ruler of Verona, attempts to prevent any further conflicts between the families by decreeing death for any individual who disturbs the peace in the future.

Romeo, the son of Montague, runs into his cousin Benvolio, who had earlier seen Romeo moping in a grove of sycamores. After some prodding by Benvolio, Romeo confides that he is in love with Rosaline, a woman who does not return his affections. Benvolio counsels him to forget this woman and find another, more beautiful one, but Romeo remains despondent. Meanwhile, Paris, a kinsman of the Prince, seeks Juliet's hand in marriage. Her father, Capulet, though happy at the match, asks Paris to wait two years since Juliet is not yet even fourteen. Capulet dispatches a servant with a list of people to invite to a masquerade and feast he traditionally holds. He invites Paris to the feast, hoping that Paris will begin to win Juliet's heart.

Romeo and Benvolio, still discussing Rosaline, encounter the Capulet servant bearing the list of invitations. Benvolio suggests that they attend since that will allow Romeo to compare his beloved to other beautiful women in Verona. Romeo agrees to go with Benvolio to the feast, but only because Rosaline, whose name he reads on the list, will be there. In Capulet's household, young Juliet talks with her mother, Lady Capulet, and her nurse about the possibility of marrying Paris. Juliet has not yet considered marriage but agrees to look at Paris during the feast to see if she thinks she could fall in love with him.

The feast begins. A melancholy Romeo follows Benvolio and their witty friend Mercutio to Capulet's house. Once inside, Romeo sees Juliet from a distance and instantly falls in love with her; he forgets about Rosaline completely. As Romeo watches Juliet, entranced, a young Capulet, Tybalt, recognizes him and is enraged that a Montague would sneak into a Capulet feast. He prepares to attack, but Capulet holds him back. Soon, Romeo speaks to Juliet, and the two experience a profound attraction. They kiss, not even knowing each other's names. When he finds out from Juliet's nurse that she is the daughter of Capulet—his family's enemy—he becomes distraught. When Juliet learns that the young man she just kissed is the son of Montague, she grows equally upset. As Mercutio and Benvolio leave the Capulet estate, Romeo leaps over the orchard wall into the garden, unable to leave Juliet behind. From his hiding place, he sees Juliet in a window above the orchard and hears her speak his name. He calls out to her, and they exchange vows of love.

Romeo hurries to see his friend and confessor, Friar Lawrence, who, though shocked at the sudden turn of Romeo's heart, agrees to marry the young lovers in secret since he sees in their love the possibility of ending the age-old feud between Capulet and Montague. The following day, Romeo and Juliet meet at Friar Lawrence's cell and are married. The Nurse, who is privy to the secret, procures a ladder, which Romeo will use to climb into Juliet's window for their wedding night.

The next day, Benvolio and Mercutio encounter Tybalt—Juliet's cousin—who, still enraged that Romeo attended Capulet's feast, has challenged Romeo to a duel. Romeo appears. Now Tybalt's kinsman by marriage, Romeo begs the Capulet to hold off the duel until he understands why Romeo does not want to fight. Disgusted with this plea for peace, Mercutio says that he will fight Tybalt himself. The two begin to duel. Romeo tries to stop them by leaping between the combatants. Tybalt stabs Mercutio under Romeo's arm, and Mercutio dies. Romeo, in a rage, kills Tybalt. Romeo flees from the scene. Soon after, the Prince declares him forever banished from Verona for his crime. Friar Lawrence arranges for Romeo to spend his wedding night with Juliet before he has to leave for Mantua the following morning.

In her room, Juliet awaits the arrival of her new husband. The Nurse enters and, after some confusion, tells Juliet that Romeo has killed Tybalt. Distraught, Juliet suddenly finds herself married to a man who has killed her kinsman. But she resettles herself and realizes that her duty belongs to her love, Romeo. Romeo sneaks into Juliet's room that night, and at last, they consummate their marriage and their love. The morning comes, and the lovers bid farewell, unsure when they will see each other again. Juliet learns that her father, affected by the recent events, now intends for her to marry Paris in just three days. Unsure of how to proceed—unable to reveal to her parents that she is married to Romeo, but unwilling to marry Paris now that she is Romeo's wife—Juliet asks her nurse for advice. She counsels Juliet to proceed as if Romeo were dead and to marry Paris, who is a better match anyway. Disgusted with the Nurse's disloyalty, Juliet disregards her advice and hurries to Friar Lawrence. He concocts a plan to reunite Juliet with Romeo in Mantua. The night before her wedding to Paris, Juliet must drink a potion that will make her appear to be dead. After she is laid to rest in the family's crypt, the Friar and Romeo will secretly retrieve her, and she will be free to live with Romeo away from their parents' feuding.

Juliet returns home to discover the wedding has been moved ahead one day, and she is to be married tomorrow. That night, Juliet drinks the potion, and the Nurse discovers her, apparently dead, the next morning. The Capulets grieve, and Juliet is entombed according to plan. But Friar Lawrence's message explaining the plan to Romeo never reaches Mantua. Its bearer, Friar John, gets confined to a quarantined house. Romeo hears only that Juliet is dead.

Romeo learns only of Juliet's death and decides to kill himself rather than live without her. He buys a vial of poison from a reluctant apothecary, then speeds back to Verona to take his own life at Juliet's tomb. Outside the Capulet crypt, Romeo comes upon Paris, who is scattering flowers on Juliet's grave. They fight, and Romeo kills Paris. He enters the tomb, sees Juliet's inanimate body, drinks the poison, and dies by her side. Just then, Friar Lawrence enters and realizes that Romeo has killed Paris and himself. At the same time, Juliet awakes. Friar Lawrence hears the coming of the watch. When Juliet refuses to leave with him, he flees alone. Juliet sees her beloved Romeo and realizes he has killed himself with poison. She kisses his poisoned lips, and when that does not kill her, she buries his dagger in her chest, falling dead upon his body.

The watch arrives, followed closely by the Prince, the Capulets, and Montague. Montague declares that Lady Montague has died of grief over Romeo's exile. Seeing their children's bodies, Capulet and Montague agree to end their long-standing feud and raise gold statues of their children side-by-side in a newly peaceful Verona.`,
